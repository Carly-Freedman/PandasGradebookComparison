# PandasGradebookComparison
Pandas gradebook code comparison - Carly Freedman. ------
Dan Weber posted a really great pandas gradebook tutorial on realpython.com. 
This program includes my take on this project and compares the runtime and data usage between my code and the source code. By defining some functions and increasing how dynamic the program is, I was able to decrease the runtime of the data loading and grade calculation process from the source code by 500%, while retrieving 60% more data points.
